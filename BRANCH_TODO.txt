List of things todo for branch, including comments from reviews not yet
implemented.


Now:

* synchronize all access to the boolean in ActiveMasterManager

* Remove TODO in HCM about Abortable interface

Think about:

* renaming master file manager?  MasterFS/MasterFileSystem


Later:

* ServerStatus/MasterStatus

  - These need new names to be more descriptive (ServerControl?)
  - They should have a very clear purpose that adds value beyond passing
    HMaster directly
  - Current idea is these things would just have accessors/setters to
    the server status booleans and abort() methods (like closed, closing,
    abortRequested)

* HBaseEventHandler/HBaseEventType/HBaseExecutorService

  - After ZK changes, renamed to EventHandler/EventType
  - Currently multiple types map to a single handler, we may want 1-to-1
  - Need to do a full review of the semantics of these once bulk of
    master rewrite is done

* LoadBalancer

  - Need to finish or back out code related to block locations
    (if finish, need to use files not directory, and use right location)
  - Put notes from reviewboard/jira into LB javadoc or hbase "book"
